This test shows a security bug in which another user wishes to delete permission on an item that that user has delegate permission on. Specifically, we wish to delete write permission on an element "x" that the user only has read permission currently. As stated in the spec in the permissions example, "Then this statement has no effect: Because this assertion is not directly present in S, nothing is removed." In the Code Minters implementation, they raise DENIED when the command should continue harmlessly. This bug should be changed so that nothing happens when I delete a permission that does not exist in the permission set.
