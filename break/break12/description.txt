This test shows a correctness bug in the JavaScript is not THAT bad implementation. Specifically, this bug shows that the database should not return multiple status codes when it raises DENIED. According to the spec, "For example, if there is a security violation, the "status" is "DENIED." In the implementation of the JavaScript is not THAT bad secure database, this test case shows that multiple statuses are returned when only one should be returned. This is directly different than what the spec specifies and what the oracle returns. This bug should be fixed by returning only DENIED, rather than both DENIED and SET_DELEGATION.
