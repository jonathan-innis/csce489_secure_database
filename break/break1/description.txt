This test case shows an availability security bug. This test case creates a long array of the string "s" and does not actually ever return the array itself. Therefore, though the process of appending to the array should take a long bit of time but should return from the program in a reasonable amount of time. The Code Minters implementation does not return within a reasonable amount of time.
