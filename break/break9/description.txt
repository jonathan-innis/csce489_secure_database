This test shows a correctness bug in the Drop Tables implementation of the secure database. Specifically, this test case shows that the foreach command does not work as intended. As shown in the spec, "For each element y in list x, replace the contents of y with the result of executing <expr>. This expression is called for each element in x, in order, and y is bound to the current element." Thus, the element "y" does not have to be an element that already exists in the database. In the Drop Tables implementation of the foreach command, they return FAILED if the element "y" does not exist in the database instead of binding each element of the list to this element one at a time. Thus, this command should return without a FAILED error but currently does in the Drop Tables implementation of the secure database.
