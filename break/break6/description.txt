This test shows a security vulnerability in the Drop Tables implementation of the secure database. Specifically, it shows that the default delegator was not implemented correctly in this implementation. According to the spec, "the system automatically delegates all from p to q." Thus, when the default delegator is admin, any new principal should have access to any record that has been created. In this particular test case, when the user jonathan is created, jonathan should have access to previous records. In the Drop Tables implementation of the secure database, jonathan does not have access to this record; instead, DENIED is returned. DENIED should not be returned in this case and everything should work as normal.
