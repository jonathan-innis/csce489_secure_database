This test shows a security vulnerability in The Lads implementation of the secure database. Specifically, this test deals with a security vulnerability where users that do not have permission to read records are still able to read records that they do not create. As specified in the spec, there are three rules that give a user reading rights on a given record: "admin has <right> on x (for all rights <right> and variables x). A principal p has <right> on x if principal anyone has <right> on x. A principal p has <right> on x if there exists some q that has <right> on x and S includes a delegation assertion x q <right> -> p." Rather than returning DENIED as the spec states and the oracle does, the The Lads implementation of the secure database returns the record. This should be changed by restricting rights to records and only allowing read access to those that have been delegate read rights.
