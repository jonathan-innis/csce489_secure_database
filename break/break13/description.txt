This test shows a security vulnerability in the JavaScript is not THAT bad implementation. Specifically, this bug shows that lists that have spaces between their braces should not be allowed given the grammar. According to the spec, "<expr> ::=  <value> | [] | { <fieldvals> }." Thus, there should not be any spaces between those two braces, as those braces are treated together as a terminal. Additionally, the Oracle returns failed given a list with a space in between the braces. The JavaScript is not THAT bad implementation should fix this bug by returning FAILED when there are spaces between the braces. Because of this vulnerability, the program is able to continue running as it should and does not return DENIED as it should in the final program.
