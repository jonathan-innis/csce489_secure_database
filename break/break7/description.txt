This test shows a correctness bug in the Drop Tables implementation of the secure database. Specifically, as stated in the spec, "When <tgt> is the keyword all then q delegates <right> to p for all variables on which q (currently) has delegate permission." In other words, "all" should be a legal target as part of the set delegation command. In the Drop Tables implementation, the "all" word does not work as a legal target for the set delegation command. Instead, the command returns FAILED when it should return nothing and work as a legal command.
