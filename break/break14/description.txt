This test shows a correctness bug in the JavaScript is not THAT bad implementation. Specifically, this bug deals with the implementation of comments in the grammar of the implementation of the secure database. As stated in the spec, "It is also permitted for a comment to be on a line by itself, as long the line begins with // without any preceding whitespace." Thus, it is explicitly stated that comments that are on their own line must not have a space preceding them or they are illegal comments. In the JavaScript is not THAT bad implementation, comments with preceding whitespaces are accepted. This should be fixed such that this is no longer the case and the program returns FAILED.
