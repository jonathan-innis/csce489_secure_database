This security bug demonstrates a availability bug. It shows that a program should return within a reasonable amount of time, especially if the program does not adhere to the grammar. In this case, the last line of the program does not adhere to the grammar, where it uses the word "retrun" instead of "return." Because it does not adhere to the grammar, it should return immediately, before executing any code with FAILED. In the case of the Code Minters implementation, the code appears to execute and not return within a reasonable time. It does return with FAILED eventually but not after a significant length of time.
