This test shows a correctness bug in the The Lads implementation of the secure database. Specifically, this test case has to deal with the fact that a user should not be able to assign permissions on a local variable. According to the spec, set delegation "Fails if x does not exist or if it is a local variable." Thus, the Oracle implementation of the secure database returns FAILED when a user attempts to assign permissions on local variables. In the The Lads implementation of the secure database, the database allows the user to delegate permissions on local variables. This should be fixed by raising a FAILED error message when this is attempted.
