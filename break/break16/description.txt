This test case shows a security vulnerability in The Lads implementation of the secure database. Specifically, it shows that users should have the ability to have read permission on a given record when permission has been delegate from admin to anyone. According to permissions in the spec, "admin has <right> on x (for all rights <right> and variables x). A principal p has <right> on x if principal anyone has <right> on x. A principal p has <right> on x if there exists some q that has <right> on x and S includes a delegation assertion x q <right> -> p." Based on these permissions standards, the implementation of the secure database should give the user Bob access to the record x in the test case rather than returning DENIED as in this test case. This should be fixed such that the implementation no longer returns denied.
