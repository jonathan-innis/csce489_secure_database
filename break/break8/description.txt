This security bug demonstrates that a user should have the ability to delete a delegation that has been assigned to them, even if they do not have delegate permission. According to the delete delegation in the spec, "No special permission is needed if the current principal is p: any non-admin principal can always deny himself rights." The Drop Tables implementation does not allow the user to delete a delegation that has assigned to them.
